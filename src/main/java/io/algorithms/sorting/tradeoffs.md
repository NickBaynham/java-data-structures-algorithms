# Tradeoffs in Sort Algorithms
- What is the complexity of the algorithm?
- How much space is needed?
- Is the sort stable?
- How many comparisons and how many element swaps needed?
- Is the sort adaptive?
- How does it scale as the input size increases?
- Is extra storage needed during execution?
- Do equal elements retain their initial order?
- Is efficiency improved on nearly sorted lists?
- Does the algorithm break early on detecting the list is sorted?
